🐢 Turtle Crossing Game
A classic arcade-style game built with Python's Turtle graphics library, where players guide a turtle safely across a busy road while avoiding oncoming traffic.
🎮 Game Overview
Navigate your turtle from the bottom of the screen to the top while dodging randomly generated cars. Each successful crossing increases the difficulty level, making cars move faster and creating a more challenging experience.
✨ Features

Progressive Difficulty: Car speed increases with each level completion
Random Car Generation: Cars spawn randomly with different colors and positions
Collision Detection: Precise collision detection system for fair gameplay
Level Tracking: Visual scoreboard displaying current level
Smooth Controls: Responsive keyboard controls for optimal gameplay experience

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system
Turtle graphics library (included with Python standard library)

Installation

Clone this repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/turtle-crossing-game.git

Navigate to the project directory:
bashcd turtle-crossing-game

Run the game:
bashpython main.py


🎯 How to Play

Start the Game: Run main.py to launch the game window
Move the Turtle: Use the Up Arrow key to move your turtle forward
Avoid Cars: Navigate between the moving cars to avoid collisions
Reach the Finish Line: Get to the top of the screen to advance to the next level
Survive: The game ends when your turtle collides with a car
Exit: Click anywhere on the screen to close the game

🏗️ Architecture
The game follows object-oriented programming principles with clear separation of concerns:

Main Module: Handles game initialization, event listening, and main game loop
Player Class: Manages turtle movement, positioning, and boundary detection
CarManager Class: Controls car creation, movement, and speed progression
Scoreboard Class: Handles level tracking and game over display

🎨 Game Mechanics
Car System

Cars spawn randomly (1 in 6 chance per frame)
Six different car colors for visual variety
Cars move from right to left at increasing speeds
Speed increases by 10 units per level

Player Movement

Turtle starts at bottom center of screen
Moves 10 pixels per key press
Automatically resets to start position after completing a level
Collision detection with 20-pixel radius

Level Progression

Level increases each time turtle reaches the top
Car speed increases progressively
Visual feedback through scoreboard updates

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Graphics: Built using Python's Turtle graphics module
Event Handling: Keyboard input processing for player movement
Object-Oriented Design: Modular classes for maintainable code
Collision Detection: Distance-based collision system
Game Loop: Continuous update cycle with proper frame timing

🎯 Future Enhancements

Add sound effects and background music
Implement power-ups and special abilities
Create multiple difficulty modes
Add high score persistence
Introduce different vehicle types
Add background graphics and animations
